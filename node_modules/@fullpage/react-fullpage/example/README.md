# Demo using Webpack

> A Reac.js project

## Build Setup

In order to generate the compiled examples files just run the following commands from this folder.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

This will create the bundle file `dist/main.js` containing the whole application. This file is then loaded in `dist/index.html`.
